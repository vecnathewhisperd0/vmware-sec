VMware Cloud Foundation security guidance currently centers around regulatory compliance. To that end, please see the VCF Compliance Kits located at:

The vSphere and vSAN Security Configuration & Hardening Guides are also good references, and contain information about applying that guidance to VCF installations. Please visit:
